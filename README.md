🎮 Tic Tac Toe — A Fun Game with HTML, CSS & JavaScript
Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe game that I built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You can play it with a friend or test your luck against a basic AI opponent. The goal? Get three in a row — just like the good old days!

✨ What It Does

  🧍‍♂️ Player vs Player mode – Take turns with a friend
  🤖 Player vs AI mode – Try to beat a simple computer opponent
  🧠 Detects win, draw, or ongoing game
  🔁 Restart the game anytime
  🧼 Clean, responsive design

Technology used:
This project is built with:
HTML (structure)
CSS (styling)
JavaScript (game logic)

No frameworks, no libraries — just good old web fundamentals.
